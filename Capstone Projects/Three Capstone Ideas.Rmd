Proposal 1

The Location Affordability Index (LAI) of California gives estimates of the percentage of a family's income dedicated to the combined cost of housing and transportation in a given location. Because what is affordable is different for everyone, users can choose among eight different family profiles--defined by household income, size, and number of commuters--and see the affordability landscape for each one in a neighborhood, city, or region.
I can get a more complete understanding of the costs of living in a given location by accounting for variations between households, neighborhoods, and regions, all of which impact affordability. For more information,
